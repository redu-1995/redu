      Coffee ceremony of Ethiopia  is a core cultural custom in Ethiopia.
      There is a routine of serving coffee daily, mainly for the purpose of 
      getting together with relatives, neighbors, or other visitors. 
      If coffee is politely declined, then tea will most  likely be served.
      Loose grass is spread on the floor where the coffee ceremony is held,
      often decorated with small yellow flowers. Composite flowers are sometimes used,
      especially around the celebration of Meskel. </P></Pre><hr> <br> <br>

        <p class="four" style="text-align: center; font-size:30px;"> ASHENDA(ኣሸንዳ)</p>
    <p class="four">Ashenda (Tigrinya: ኣሸንዳ; Amharic: አሸንዳ) is a national festival celebrated by Tigray (Ethiopia), Agew (Ethiopia, Eritrea), Amhara (Ethiopia), and Eritrea. Ashenda also known as "Girls’ day" is a festival awaited by Habesha women of all ages. Although Ashenda is celebrated primarily by teenage girls, females of all age group get to participate in this national festival, during this festival men are expected to be on their best behavior. Habesha girls prepare for the celebration of Ashenda in leading months. Prior to the celebration, groups of girls make preparations for the holiday by buying new clothes, visiting hairdressers, preparing drums and harvesting the distinctive 'Ashenda' grass (which will be tied around their waist for the celebration). The holiday started as a cultural one, but evolved to a religious one. Its origin can be traced to ancient Israel a common way Hebrew women celebrated their Holidays, victory, heroes (Exodus 15:20) After the introduction of Christianity into Ethiopia in the 4th century AD the celebration began to have religious tone and merge with Christian beliefs, those celebrating it now see it as a commemoration of the heavenly ascension of the Virgin Mary following her Dormition, a feast called Filseta. It is typically celebrated between 16 and 26 August every year.</p>
